# WrapTunes

Little OS X app that opens your favorite web music service in a WebView and lets you control it using the media keys on your Mac.
Don't forget to press the play/pause key with Command or something!
Otherwise the system will start iTunes.

For now, it only supports Yandex.Music.
If you want to use a different service, change the URL and JavaScripts it WrapTunes/WTAppDelegate.m.
I'll add settings and multiple service support soon.
