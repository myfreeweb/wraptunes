# WrapTunes

Little OS X app that opens your favorite web music service in a WebView and lets you control it using the media keys on your Mac.
Don't forget to press the play/pause key with Command or something!
Otherwise the system will start iTunes.

To add new music services, edit ~/.wraptunes.plist in your text editor.
